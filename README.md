# KNIME-Deep-Learning

This repository is going to contain all the relevant documentation to my KNIME workflows, which focuses on computer vision and deep learning.
Each file will contain one workflow, and documentation that will support that details the process in KNIME.
The following are links to all datasets and workflows on the KNIME HUB, of which you can then download the full workflow from.
The categories for the workflows in this repository are as follows: <br/>

1.Image Classification <br/>
2.Image Segmentation & Prediction <br/>
3.Sentiment Analysis <br/>
4.Time Series Classification<br/>
5.Time Series Forecasting <br/>

Disclaimer: Most machine learning workflows will include data augmentation as part of their project. However, KNIME has some issues with augmenting image data, therefore I have chosen to skip this step in all my workflows. Augmentation is still a very important part of machine learning and it would bode well to understand its importance, but for the very purpose of the following workflows it has not been used. The training still works fine as all the datasets are still quite large regardless.<br/>

### Additional Information
Some of the following workflows are inspired by Anson’s Github and will be referencing that from time to time in the document. Make sure to read through his explanations for detailed understanding and to compare the utilization of deep learning both in KNIME and Python.
